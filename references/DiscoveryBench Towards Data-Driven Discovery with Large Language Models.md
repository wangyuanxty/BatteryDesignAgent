Abstract
Can the rapid advances in code generation, function calling, and data analysis using large language models (LLMs) help automate the search and verification of hypotheses purely from a set of provided datasets?
To evaluate this question, we present
DiscoveryBench
, the first comprehensive benchmark that formalizes the multi-step process of data-driven discovery.
The benchmark is designed to systematically assess current model capabilities in discovery tasks and provide a useful resource for improving them.
Our benchmark contains 264 tasks collected across 6 diverse domains, such as sociology and engineering, by manually deriving discovery workflows from published papers
to approximate the real-world challenges faced by researchers, where each task is defined by a dataset, its metadata, and a discovery goal in natural language.
We additionally provide 903 synthetic tasks to conduct controlled evaluations across task complexity.
Furthermore, our structured formalism of data-driven discovery enables a facet-based evaluation that provides useful insights into different failure modes.
We evaluate several popular LLM-based reasoning frameworks using both open and closed
LLMs as baselines on
DiscoveryBench
and find that even the best system scores only 25%.
Our benchmark, thus, illustrates the challenges in autonomous data-driven discovery and serves as a valuable resource for the community to make progress.

Introduction
Knowledge discovery via the scientific process
has been a catalyst for human progress for centuries
but has, thus far, been a predominantly manual pursuit
[
16
]
.
Recent breakthroughs in capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to reason and interface with the world using code
[
9
,
40
]
, external tools
[
41
]
, and interactive agents
[
51
,
32
]
, however, now suggest the possibility of realizing a discovery system that is fully autonomous.
Indeed, recent works
[
33
]
provide initial evidence for this paradigm within the setting of
data-driven discovery
, where both search and verification of hypotheses may be carried out using a dataset alone (i.e.,
after physical experiments and data collection
1

In practice, experiments and analysis are interleaved, not sequential. Our concern
in this work, however, is systematically studying the data analysis part of the (interleaved) pipeline.
),
but the extent of this ability remains unclear.
We, therefore, aim to systematically evaluate the following question:
How good are current state-of-the-art LLMs at automated data-driven discovery?
Figure 1:
Each
DiscoveryBench
task consists of a goal and dataset(s) (left). Solving the task requires both statistical analysis and scientific semantic reasoning, e.g., deciding which analysis is appropriate for the domain, and mapping goal terms to column names (center). A faceted evaluation allows open-ended final answers to be rigorously evaluated (right).
Answering this question is hard, as data-driven discovery in the wild (real-world) is
diverse across domains and subject areas, which in turn makes it difficult to build
a robust evaluation framework to measure progress.
We address this using a pragmatic formalization of data-driven discovery, namely
the search for a
relationship
that may hold between
variables
in a
context
,
where (importantly) the description of those facets may not be in the language of the
dataset. A data-driven discovery task then has one of these components missing, e.g., “How
did urban land use affect the invasion of introduced plants in Catalonia?".
Importantly, this formalization allows for systematic,
reproducible evaluation over a wide variety of real-world problems, by leveraging these facets (Fig
1
, right).
Unlike prior datasets for statistical analysis
[
28
]
or AutoML
[
55
,
15
]
,
DiscoveryBench
tasks
also require scientific semantic reasoning, for instance, deciding which of the many possible
analysis techniques are appropriate for the domain (e.g., spatial autocorrelation for
plant invasion, Fig
1
center), how to clean and/or normalize the data,
and how to map goal terms to dataset terms (e.g., “land use” to “habitat type”). Task
solutions typically requires a multistep workflow (Fig
1
, center).
In this way,
DiscoveryBench
is the first
large-scale dataset to address the broader data-driven discovery pipeline, not just
the statistical analysis component, and explore LLMs’ capacity for this.
Given this framework, we created
DiscoveryBench
by manually extracting 264 discovery tasks, i.e., goal + dataset(s), from over 20 published papers, as well as creating real-world discovery workflows
that solve each task. We additionally provide 903 synthetic tasks across 48
domains generated using LLMs to mimic the real-world discovery process. The synthetic
benchmark allows us to conduct controlled model evaluations by varying task difficulty.
Our contributions are thus:
•
DiscoveryBench
, the first comprehensive benchmark to formalize
the multi-step process of data-driven hypothesis search and verification,
covering many real-world discovery tasks plus additional synthetic tasks.
•
A pragmatic formalism for data-driven discovery, flexible enough to
characterize many real-world tasks while constrained enough to allow
for rigorous, reproducible evaluation.
•
A comprehensive evaluation across state-of-the-art LLM-based reasoning methods (“discovery agents”).
We find performance peaks at 25%, demonstrating the challenging nature of our task.
These suggest that
DiscoveryBench
may be a valuable resource for helping make progress
on autonomous, data-driven discovery.

Related Work
Automated data-driven discovery has been a long-standing dream of AI
[
33
,
21
]
.
Although there have been a range of
data-driven discovery systems
,
from early ones that fit equations to idealized data, e.g., Bacon
[
23
]
,
to more modern ones handling complex real-world problems, e.g., AlphaFold
[
19
]
,
their associated datasets are task-specific and customized to a
pre-built pipeline. In contrast,
DiscoveryBench
aims to be a general
test over multiple tasks, including testing whether systems can
design appropriate pipelines themselves.
A number of datasets and tools are available for
AutoML
, a related
technology aimed at automating workflows for building optimal machine
learning models
[
18
,
55
,
24
]
.
AutoML tools include packages like Scikit
[
13
]
,
and embedded in cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform,
Microsoft Azure,
and Amazon Web Services.
However, associated datasets for AutoML are primarily used for training models,
rather than for open-ended discovery tasks.
Similarly, there are several datasets that test
statistical
analysis
in various fields, e.g.,
[
42
,
25
,
50
]
.
Software packages like Tableaux, SAS, and R also support users in that task.
However, these datasets and tools are designed specifically for data analysis,
while
DiscoveryBench
aims to automate the broader pipeline including ideation,
semantic reasoning, and pipeline design, where statistical analysis is just one component.
One recent dataset similar in spirit to ours is QRData
[
28
]
.
QRData also explores LLM capabilities but targets statistical/causal analysis for well-defined (mainly) textbook questions that have unique, (mainly) numeric gold answers.
In contrast,
DiscoveryBench
has no prescribed boundaries on statistical techniques to apply,
uses open-ended questions and answers, and complex tasks drawn from state-of-the-art published work.

Formalization
We begin by formalizing what we mean by a data-driven hypothesis and how the structure of a complex hypothesis may be viewed as a hypothesis semantic tree.
A
data-driven hypothesis
h
h
in
ℋ
\mathcal{H}
(the space of such hypotheses) is a declarative sentence about the state of the world whose truth value may be inferred from a given dataset
D
D
using a verification procedure
𝒱
D
:
ℋ
→
{
supported
,
unsupported
}
\mathcal{V}_{D}:\mathcal{H}\to\{\mathrm{supported},\mathrm{unsupported}\}
, for instance, via statistical modeling.
Each hypothesis may further be expressed using a propositional formula
ϕ
\phi
over a set of
sub-hypotheses
h
i
∈
ℋ
h_{i}\in\mathcal{H}
using logical connectives, e.g., disjunctions and conjunctions, such that
h
:=
ϕ
⁡
(
h
1
,
…
,
h
n
)
h:=\phi(h_{1},\ldots,h_{n})
and
𝒱
D
​
(
h
)
=
ϕ
⁡
(
𝒱
D
​
(
h
1
)
,
…
,
𝒱
D
​
(
h
n
)
)
\mathcal{V}_{D}(h)=\phi(\mathcal{V}_{D}(h_{1}),\ldots,\mathcal{V}_{D}(h_{n}))
. For instance, suppose
h
h
is the hypothesis
“for men younger than 20, popularity of product A varies proportional to their age
(
h
1
h_{1}
)
, while there exists an inverse relationship for those older than 40
(
h
2
h_{2}
)
”
, then
h
h
can be expressed as the conjunction
h
1
∧
h
2
h_{1}\wedge h_{2}
.
Inspired by recent work of
Thompson and Skau 2023
, we additionally introduce a structured formalism that breaks a hypothesis down into
three hypothesis dimensions
:
•
Contexts
(
c
)
(c)
:
Boundary conditions that limit the scope of a hypothesis.
E.g.,
“for men over the age of 30”
or
“in Asia and Europe”
or unbounded/full dataset when not specified.
•
Variables
(
v
)
(v)
:
Known set of
concepts that interact in a meaningful way under a given context to produce the hypothesis. E.g.,
gender
,
age
, or
income
. Note that each hypothesis is associated with a target variable and a set of independent variables.
•
Relationships
(
r
)
(r)
:
Interactions between a given set of variables under a given context that produces the hypothesis. E.g.,
“quadratic relationship”
,
“inversely proportional”
, or piecewise conditionals.
With slight abuse of notation, we can now equivalently define hypothesis
h
:=
ψ
⁡
(
c
,
v
,
r
)
h:=\psi(c,v,r)
, where
ψ
⁡
(
⋅
,
⋅
,
⋅
)
\psi(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)
returns the declarative sentence
“under context
c
c
, variables
v
v
have relationship
r
r
.”
For instance, for sub-hypothesis
h
1
h_{1}
in our example above,
c
1
:=
c_{1}:=
“men younger than 20”
,
v
1
:=
v_{1}:=
{
gender
,
consumer_age
,
product_popularity
}, and
r
1
:=
r_{1}:=
“popularity is proportional to age”
.
Figure 2:
Hypothesis Semantic Tree
Hypothesis Semantic Tree.
Observe that each independent variable in a hypothesis may itself be a target variable for a prior hypothesis.
To emphasize this hierarchical nature, we introduce the concept of a
hypothesis semantic tree
whose nodes are variables (independent or derived) and whose sub-trees represent hypotheses, as follows. Consider a hypothesis
h
h
.
A semantic hypothesis tree
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
with
h
h
as the
primary
hypothesis is a Markov tree whose root node is the target variable of
h
h
, each of whose leaf nodes is an independent variable that is not derived further, and each of whose internal nodes is the target variable of an
intermediate
hypothesis.
In other words, each sub-tree
𝒯
h
′
\mathcal{T}_{h^{\prime}}
rooted at an internal node
v
v
of
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
is itself a hypothesis semantic tree for a hypothesis
h
′
h^{\prime}
with
v
v
as the target variable.
In particular, a sub-tree rooted at
v
v
and all its immediate children
C
v
C_{v}
implicitly encodes
h
′
h^{\prime}
as
ψ
⁡
(
c
,
{
v
}
∪
C
v
,
r
)
\psi(c,\{v\}\cup C_{v},r)
where
r
r
is the relationship between
v
v
and
C
v
C_{v}
under context
c
c
as specified in
h
′
h^{\prime}
.
More generally,
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
can encode many different hypotheses by choosing one node as the target variable and considering nodes at arbitrary descendant levels as independent variables.
For instance, in Fig
2
, we show a semantic tree
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
with the following primary hypothesis (
h
h
):
“The visibility of a galaxy reduces when the blue spectrum dominates and the distance of the galaxy from Earth increases”
, where
galaxy_visibility
(
v
0
v_{0}
) is the target variable with independent variables
distance
(
v
1
v_{1}
) and
galaxy_color
(
v
2
v_{2}
). Consider now the sub-tree rooted at
v
2
v_{2}
, which encodes the following intermediate hypothesis:
“Visibility of blue light from galaxies increases with an increase in galaxy size and decrease in star density”
, where
galaxy_color
(
v
2
v_{2}
) is the target variable with independent variables
galaxy_size
(
v
3
v_{3}
) and
galaxy_density
(
v
4
v_{4}
). Note further that due to there existing ancestor edges from
v
3
v_{3}
and
v
4
v_{4}
to
v
0
v_{0}
,
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
also encodes the hypothesis:
“The visibility of a galaxy reduces with distance from Earth combined with an increase in galaxy size and decrease in star density”
, where the target variable is
v
0
v_{0}
and the independent variables are
v
3
v_{3}
and
v
4
v_{4}
.
(Task) Dataset.
We formally define a dataset
D
D
on which hypothesis search and verification is performed as a collection of tuples
{
𝐱
i
}
i
=
1
m
\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}
that
supports
multiple hypothesis semantic trees
resulting in a
semantic forest
ℱ
:=
∪
i
𝒯
h
(
i
)
\mathcal{F}:=\cup_{i}\mathcal{T}_{h^{(i)}}
, where each
𝐱
i
\mathbf{x}_{i}
is a row in the dataset and
x
∈
𝐱
i
x\in\mathbf{x}_{i}
is an observation for a particular column. Further,
𝐱
i
\mathbf{x}_{i}
may span only a subset of nodes in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
, i.e., not all nodes in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
may be observed.
Specifically, while roots and leaves are always observed, internal nodes (target variables for intermediate hypotheses) may be latent.
Therefore, multiple versions of
D
D
may be collected for
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
with different degrees of observability of internal nodes, altering the difficulty of the discovery task.

DiscoveryBench
We now introduce a novel benchmark,
DiscoveryBench
, for discovering data-driven hypotheses. In this benchmark, a
data-driven discovery task
is defined as follows: Given one or more task dataset(s)
D
D
and a discovery goal
G
G
, derive a hypothesis
h
=
ψ
⁡
(
c
,
v
,
r
)
h=\psi(c,v,r)
addressing
G
G
with the highest specificity for the context
c
c
, variables
v
v
, and relationship
r
r
supported by
D
D
. Optionally, a workflow of deriving such a hypothesis can be outputted to augment information already present in the hypothesis.
DiscoveryBench
has two components: 
encompassing data-driven hypotheses and workflows derived from published scientific papers and
DB-Synth
capturing systemic variations in data-driven hypotheses and workflows obtained from synthetically generated datasets. We release our dataset under the ODC-BY license:
https://github.com/allenai/discoverybench
.
4.1
: Collecting data-driven hypotheses in the wild
Our goal is to replicate the scientific process undertaken by researchers to search for and validate a hypothesis from one or more datasets. We focus on six scientific domains where data-driven research is the cornerstone of scientific progress: sociology, biology, humanities, economics, engineering, and meta-science. Our data collection follows either a
data-first
or
code-first
approach.
For the
data-first approach
: 1) we filter papers based on open public datasets (
D
D
) such as National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and World Bank Open Data (WBOD) that have workflow details; 2) we then try to replicate these workflows in Python. For this data-first approach, replication took up to 90 person-hours per dataset, often (30%) not resulting in success. This highlights building data-driven discovery benchmarks from real studies is not only challenging and time-consuming, but automating discovery can also be key for scientific progress and reproducibility.
The data-first approach by design is limited to well-known aforementioned public datasets. To improve diversity in domains, datasets (
D
D
), and workflows, we also adopted a
code-first approach
to look beyond popular public datasets.
In this approach, we 1) search for code repositories based on scientific papers with available datasets and 2) attempt to replicate them in Python with existing code or from scratch with interpretation of the associated paper. We looked at 785 data points in Zenodo, EU’s Open Research Repository, with a filter for computational notebooks. Over 85% of the repositories either had missing code, code that could not be easily translated to Python, or a proprietary/non-open dataset. We finalized a candidate list of 14 repositories, but in the end, 3 of them passed all our checks for their hypotheses to be included in the benchmark
2

Some repositories include hypotheses from multiple papers as their background.
.
Figure 3:
Workflow categories in  with representative examples.
Upon replication of the result or implementation of the full procedure as described in the paper, we include the (dataset
D
D
, hypothesis
h
h
, implementation workflow) tuple to the benchmark.
During the process, the implementation workflow may lead to other hypotheses that are not directly reported in the paper but can be supported by the data.
We included them in
DiscoveryBench
, which leads to a good mix of already reported science-worthy hypotheses as well as novel
hypotheses grounded in datasets. This is particularly useful as our goal is to evaluate LLMs’ ability to solve a discovery task that is realistic but never reported before.
Finally, the task datasets are supplemented with a dataset description, natural language descriptions of the columns, and additional background knowledge related to the domain or the datasets. Some of our tasks, for instance, archaeology, require domain knowledge to derive a particular hypothesis.
Inferring task difficulty.
Using the hypothesis semantic tree defined in Section
3
, we say that the difficulty of a discovery task is proportional to the
path length
from an observed node to the target hypothesis node in the tree.
However, knowing the tree structure from a task dataset alone is impractical due to incomplete
a priori
information about unobserved intermediate nodes and edges between observed nodes.
To infer task difficulty, we, therefore, approximate the path length between the target and leaf nodes using the length of the implementation workflow required to derive a target hypothesis. Specifically, for each step in the workflow, we add
1
1
to the discovery path length.
In some cases, we derive two tasks: easy and hard from the same hypothesis, where for easy, we provide the derived variables as observed variables in the dataset (e.g., BMI), and for hard, it would require deriving intermediate variables (BMI from height and weight) to reach the target.
Additionally, given the view of a task dataset as encoding the union of multiple semantic trees rooted at different hypotheses, i.e., a semantic forest
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
, we further posit that task difficulty increases as the number of trees in the forest (
|
ℱ
|
|\mathcal{F}|
) increases. Intuitively, discovery becomes harder as the hypothesis search space increases. In practice, this setting is observed when a task requires access to multiple datasets.
Forming discovery goals.
By definition, each hypothesis can be fully specified by the declarative sentence as
h
:=
ψ
⁡
(
c
,
v
,
r
)
h:=\psi(c,v,r)
. To systematically construct the discovery goals for the task, we first mask one of each dimension, context
c
c
, variable
v
v
, relationship
r
r
, and generate a discovery goal to identify the masked information given the rest of the hypothesis and the task dataset(s). For instance, for a target hypothesis,
“The effect of socioeconomic status on college degree completion is higher for females (0.4995) than males (0.4467)”
, we form a discovery goal as
“How does socioeconomic status impact on college degree completion for females compared to males?”
seeking the relationship
r
r
to be discovered from the dataset(s) given the relevant variables
v
v
and context
c
c
. Additionally, we ensure each discovery goal leads to only one answer, i.e., the target hypothesis.

shows the diversity of tasks both in train and test split for . Most importantly, the benchmark incorporates 114 (4 + 110) tasks that require more than one related datasets
to be analyzed, with a maximum of 6 datasets
for a task. Each workflow within the dataset can be viewed as a composition of unit actions—such as code generation for statistical tests—that LLMs excel at, showing how our tasks require the chaining of such atomic actions to address complex scenarios for data-driven discovery. We measure the complexity of these workflows by quantifying the number of unit actions involved, referring to this as the
workflow length
, whose distribution can be seen in Fig
5
.
4.2
DB-Synth
: Generating data-driven hypotheses using LLMs
To scale data collection, we next introduce a supplementary benchmark,
which is synthetically constructed to enable controlled model evaluations.
Our goal is to reverse-engineer the process of hypothesis discovery to synthesize datasets and discovery tasks of varying difficulty that require analysis workflows similar to those in the real-world benchmark.
Our approach leverages the broad pre-trained knowledge of LLMs in four stages:
Domain sampling:
First, we prompt the model to generate a list of diverse topics or
domains
along with their natural language descriptions. E.g.,
“Ancient architecture”
→
\rightarrow
“Related to historic buildings, architectural marvels, and ancient construction techniques”.
Semantic tree construction:
For each domain, we then build a semantic tree
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
,
recursively deriving nodes starting from a primary hypothesis
h
h
. Specifically, we prompt the model with the domain and a sampled real-world workflow (e.g., “within-cluster analysis”) to generate a hypothesis and its target variable.
Setting the target variable as root, we then derive child nodes by generating the independent variables required to verify
h
h
using
𝒱
⁡
(
⋅
)
\mathcal{V}(\cdot)
.
We operationalize this by generating a column name and description for each child node (along with a data type and range) and a pandas expression

The pandas expression encodes the structured hypothesis

)
\psi(c,v,r)

[

]
over only independent variables in
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
such that its execution results in the target variable. We repeat this with each leaf in
𝒯
h
\mathcal{T}_{h}
as the root of a new semantic sub-tree, generating intermediate hypotheses and a new set of variables until the desired height of
𝒯
\mathcal{T}
is reached.

In practice, with probability 0.6, we choose whether a node is derived further or marked as a leaf.
We also generate a set of distractor columns disjoint from nodes in
𝒯
\mathcal{T}
, thus resulting in a synthetic semantic forest
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
.
Data generation:
We then construct a task dataset
D
:=
{
𝐱
i
}
i
=
1
m
D:=\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}
by generating synthetic data in a bottom-up manner (i.e., from leaves to root) for each node in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
. Starting with various sampling strategies for leaf nodes (see more in Sec
D
),
for each subsequent level in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
, we create new columns for nodes by simply executing their pandas expressions.
Finally, to mimic real-world challenges in data collection, we probabilistically perturb each instance
x
∈
𝐱
i
x\in\mathbf{x}_{i}
by adding noise or dropping values
to create missing data
6

Each value is noised independently; therefore, each row has sufficient true data useful for discovery.
.
Note that at this stage,
D
D
contains a column for each node in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
.
Task generation:
For each internal node
h
h
in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
, we now create multiple task datasets
D
h
(
l
)
D_{h}^{(l)}
from
D
D
, varying the difficulty of the discovery task based on the path length
l
l
between
h
h
and the observed independent variables in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
.
Finally, we follow the same strategy for goal formulation as .
We generate 903 tasks over 48 diverse domains and assign them to train, dev, and test sets using a 60/20/20 split, where each task is additionally tagged with a difficulty level from 1-4. While we evaluate our agents on the test, the training set can serve as supervised data for improving models.

Evaluation
We evaluate task performance by measuring the alignment of the predicted and gold hypotheses in natural language.

We take inspiration from recent works in LLM benchmarking
[

and design a model-based evaluation strategy using
gpt-4-preview-0125
as the
evaluator
, conditioned on our structured formalism of data-driven hypotheses.
Recall the propositional form
h

(
h
1
,
…
,
h
n
)
h:=\phi(h_{1},\ldots,h_{n})
of a hypothesis
h
h
that decomposes it into sub-hypotheses. We first use our GPT-4 based evaluator to independently decompose the gold (
h

h
p
h^{p}
) hypotheses into their respective sub-hypotheses
{
h

,
asking it to also identify, for each sub-hypothesis
h
k

,
its context, variables, and relationship dimensions (prompt in
Figure

). Given this structured representation of the gold and predicted hypotheses, we then compute a
hypothesis match score (HMS)
, which measures the degree to which two hypotheses align on each dimension, as follows.
To compute HMS, we match each predicted sub-hypothesis
h
j
p
h^{p}_{j}
with a gold sub-hypothesis
h
i
g
h^{g}_{i}
when their contexts are judged as equivalent by our GPT-4 based evaluator (prompt in
Figure
7
).
8

8
Note that at most one gold sub-hypothesis is matched with a predicted sub-hypothesis.
Let
M
M
denote this set of context-matched pairs of predicted and gold sub-hypotheses. At this point, treating each sub-hypothesis context as a single unit, we can compute an F1 score,
ctx
F1
\mathrm{ctx}_{\mathrm{F1}}
, capturing how aligned the
n
n
contexts of sub-hypothesis of
h
g
h^{g}
with the
m
m
contexts of sub-hypotheses of
h
p
h^{p}
. Then, for each matched pair of sub-hypotheses, we measure how well the variables and relations align, using an F1 score for the variables (
var
F1
\mathrm{var}_{\mathrm{F1}}
) and an accuracy score for the relation (
rel
acc
\mathrm{rel}_{\mathrm{acc}}
).
Specifically, for each sub-hypothesis pair in
M
M
, we extract the set of interacting variables
in the gold and predicted sub-hypotheses using the GPT-4 based evaluator (prompt in
Figure
8
). We compute the alignment between these two sets of variables as an F1 score,
var
F1
\mathrm{var}_{\mathrm{F1}}
, similar to how
ctx
F1
\mathrm{ctx}_{\mathrm{F1}}
was computed. For relationships, we compute relationship accuracy with reference to the relationship between the gold variables
(
rel
acc
\mathrm{rel}_{\mathrm{acc}}
) based on evaluator judgments using the following scoring heuristic:
100
100
if there is an exact match of the relation,
50
50
when the predicted relationship is broader than the gold relationship but encompasses it, and
0
0
otherwise (prompt in
Figure
9
).
Finally, we compute HMS
∈
[
0,100
]
\in[0,100]
as the average alignment of the variable and relationship dimensions over context-matched sub-hypotheses, weighted by the overall context alignment:

Experiments
5.1
Discovery Agents
We benchmark state-of-the-art LLM-based few-shot reasoning methods as discovery agents with two closed models, GPT-4o and GPT-4-0125-preview (GPT-4p), and one open, Llama-3-70B, model powering the reasoning methods. A discovery agent takes the task description, paths to the task dataset(s)
D
D
, metadata about the datasets (description, column descriptions), and the goal,
G
G
, to produce a natural language (NL) hypothesis specified by context, variables, and relationship.
•
CodeGen
generates the entire code at one go to solve the task, where we provide a demonstration of a solution code in the context. After code execution and based on the result, it generates the NL hypothesis and summarizes the workflow.
•
ReAct
[
51
]
solves the task by generating thought and subsequent codes in a multi-turn fashion.
•
DataVoyager
is a multi-component data-driven discovery agent from
[
33
]
. It has four components, planner, code generator, data analysis, and critic, that orchestrate the discovery process.
•
Reflexion (Oracle)
[
44
]
is an extension of CodeGen agent, where at the end of one trial, we provide the “oracle”
HMS
\mathrm{HMS}
score as an evaluation signal, and it generates a reflection to improve (when
HMS
<
1
\mathrm{HMS}<1
) in the next trial till it solves the task, or maximum trials (3) are reached.
•
NoDataGuess
guesses the hypothesis (in ) just from the dataset description and the goal without accessing the datasets where we measure LLM’s memorization of already published works.
5.2
Main Results
Fig
4
(left) shows that overall performance for all framework-LLM pairs is low for both  and
DB-Synth
, highlighting the challenging nature of the task and the benchmark. Most importantly, effective reasoning prompts such as React and planning with a self-critic (DataVoyager) do not help improve the simple CodeGen agent. But with oracle feedback, Reflexion (Oracle) significantly improves over CodeGen (base) performance.
Analysis reveals that almost all non-reflexion agents solve the
easiest
(in terms of workflow category and length) instances from the benchmark. GPT-4o refuses to hallucinate in the NoDataGuess baseline, whereas surprisingly Llama-3 performs similarly in both data and no-data modes.
We additionally observe that the models’ performance in  and
DB-Synth
are similar, indicating our synthetic benchmark captures complexities of the real workflow but provides a systematic way to analyze the models’ performance.
5.3
Analysis
Context is important.
Fig
4
(right) shows the trends of the
ctx
F1
\mathrm{ctx}_{\mathrm{F1}}
and combined
var
F1
×
rel
acc
\mathrm{var}_{\mathrm{F1}}\times\mathrm{rel}_{\mathrm{acc}}
. A positive trend signifies that to predict variables and relationships accurately, precise and accurate context prediction is necessary. However, correct identification of context is an important first step, although it does not guarantee success.
Workflow complexity barrier.
Almost all agents struggle more with tasks involving complex statistical techniques, complex data preparation methods, or domain-specific models. The top three workflow categories where the best non-oracle model was highly performant are correlation analysis (55%), data selection (18%), and summary statistics (18%), whereas the lowest three workflow categories are spatial analysis (0%), pollen dating (0%), and ecological modeling (0%).
Figure 5:
Best non-oracle agent’s performance (
HMS
\mathrm{HMS}
) (a) across domains, (b) for goal types (dimension to be discovered), and (c) for different workflow lengths. In (c) workflow length categories for  are s:
<
10
<10
, m:
>
10
,
<
20
>10,<20
, l:
>
20
>20
. For
DB-Synth
, it is the semantic tree height.
Domain knowledge dependency.
To check if additional domain helps agents perform better, we collect targeted domain knowledge for the archaeology-related tasks that needed significant domain knowledge during data collection. When added as additional hints, we find that DataVoyager’s (GPT-4p) performance jumps from 9.9% (w/ domain knowledge) to 17.5% (w/o domain knowledge).
Performance across domains and goal types.
Fig
5
(a) depicts that biology (0%) and engineering (7%) perform the worst due to their higher dependence on advanced statistical methods, while economics (25%) and sociology (23%) perform better. Additionally, Fig
5
(b) shows goals related to discovering a relationship given context and variables are more easily solved than the other two types of goals, finding context and variables. This is explained by the complexity of the hypothesis search, which is broader for finding the right context or a set of variables given a fixed relationship, whereas finding the relationship given context and variables is easier.
Impact of workflow length.
Inherently, the difficulty of the tasks is measured by the gold workflow length () or the height of the semantic tree (
DB-Synth
).
Figure
5
(c) shows a decreasing trend in performance as workflow length (hence, complexity) increases. The performance drops significantly even for medium-length workflows, highlighting current agents’ limitations.

Conclusion
We present
DiscoveryBench
, the first data-driven discovery benchmark consisting of 264 discovery tasks that capture real scientific workflows extracted from published works. We supplement this with 903 structurally generated synthetic tasks, tailored to evaluate discovery agents at various levels of difficulty. We benchmark state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks with the most advanced LLMs, but the best agent’s performance only peaks at 25% underscoring the challenging nature of the task and the benchmark. We hope our timely contribution can increase interest and efforts in making progress on reliable and reproducible autonomous scientific discovery using large generative models.

Appendix B
Limitations
We currently filtered domains and tasks that required forecasting, simulation, or very specific modeling (species distribution, infection spread, astrophysics equations for exoplanets) in the benchmark as they were very time-consuming to replicate as well as discover hypotheses. As a result, we discarded more papers focused on natural and physical sciences compared to social sciences, which we plan to include in future benchmarks.
We currently do not tackle the challenge of understanding and processing massive datasets, such as the 8.92 petabytes data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (
https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov
) or the extensive brain data from the Allen Institute (
https://alleninstitute.org/division/brain-science
). While the potential to discover new insights from such vast data volumes is significant, ensuring these findings are robust and not subject to
p
p
-hacking remains unaddressed by our current methods.
We currently do not handle multi-modal data and complex pipelines, such as those needed for analyzing satellite and other geospatial data relevant to climate science and astronomy data. This would involve multiple stages of data processing, the use of various tools, and managing workflow complexities, for example, analyzing thousands of species patterns combined with satellite data to study habitats. So we do not incorporate workflows like those of EarthRanger (
https://www.earthranger.com
).
Ethical Considerations
There could be many potential societal consequences of systems tuned on our proposed benchmark since it involves using LLMs, such as policy misuse, legal ramifications, and false discovery. On the positive side, our proposed benchmark can advance the rate of discovery, leading to an improved standard of living and social well-being.
Appendix C
Data collection for
For data-first approach, replication took 15 to 40 person-hours for each NLS-related paper and up to 90 person-hours
for the GBIF dataset, where specialized domain knowledge and tools led to higher complexity. All papers replicated in the NLS dataset were included, while less than half of the papers in specialized datasets like GBIF and WBOD were added to
DiscoveryBench
.

Appendix D
Data Generation for
DB-Synth
For leaves, we use different sampling strategies based on the data type.
Specifically, for categorical nodes, we sample instances with replacement from the range of allowed values, whereas for numeric, we first select a distribution (e.g., normal) and its parameters based on the specified range and then perform sampling.
For each subsequent level in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
, we create new columns for nodes by simply executing their pandas expressions
9
9
9
The expression is guaranteed to only have variables already generated due to the bottom-up construction.
.
To recover from any execution errors, we additionally use a self-refine
[
30
]
approach to generate new pandas expressions guided by the execution error logs.
Finally, to mimic real-world challenges in data collection, we probabilistically perturb each instance
x
∈
𝐱
i
x\in\mathbf{x}_{i}
by adding noise or dropping values
to create missing data
10
10
10
Each value is noised independently; therefore, each row has sufficient true data useful for discovery.
.
After generation,
D
D
contains a column for each node in
ℱ
\mathcal{F}
.

Datasheets
E.1
Motivation
•
For what purpose was the dataset created?
DiscoveryBench
is created to help assess large language models’ (LLMs) ability to automate the search and verification of hypotheses purely from a set of provided datasets.
•
Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?
Authors belong to the Allen Institute for AI, OpenLocus, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The data collection is part of research efforts conducted by the Allen Institute for AI.
•
Who funded the creation of the dataset?
Allen Institute for AI.
E.2
Collection Process
•
How was the data associated with each instance acquired?
Our goal is to replicate the scientific process undertaken by researchers to search for and validate a hypothesis from one or more datasets. We focus on six scientific domains where data-driven research is the cornerstone of scientific progress: sociology, biology, humanities, economics, engineering, and meta-science. Our data collection follows either a
data-first
or
code-first
approach. Each instance has been manually implemented and verified by the authors for solvability.
E.3
Uses
•
Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?
We use this benchmark to evaluate LLM’s ability to search and verify hypotheses purely from a set of datasets.
•
Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?
We do not expect the community members to use this data to train models that can aggravate
p
p
-hacking.
E.4
Distribution and Maintainance
•
How will the dataset will be distributed?
We distribute this benchmark via our
Github
repository:
https://github.com/allenai/discoverybench
and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/discoverybench
.

F.2
Directory structure for
There may be more than one query per metadata. The train split contains 14 metadata files and 25 queries. The test split contains 144 metadata files and 239 queries. Metadata folders with the same prefixes use the same underlying dataset with either a subset or a preprocessed version. When dealing with a full dataset (i.e., nls_raw), the task becomes substantially harder due to the data preparation required.
