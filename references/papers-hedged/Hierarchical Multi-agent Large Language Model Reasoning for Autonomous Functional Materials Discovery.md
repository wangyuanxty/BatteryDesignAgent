Abstract
Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific exploration, but most methods automate procedural tasks without engaging in scientific reasoning, limiting autonomy in discovery. We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M–N–C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias. Altogether, multi-agent collaboration accelerates materials discovery and marks a new paradigm for autonomous scientific exploration.

Introduction
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have expanded its role in scientific research, enabling systems to analyze data, identify patterns, and even propose hypotheses.
[
6
]
Yet, most of these models operate within fixed objectives and have limited ability to deliberate about scientific questions or adapt their strategies based on outcomes. Reasoning, the process of evaluating competing hypotheses and designing informative experiments, is central to genuine scientific exploration. In materials research, where the search space spans millions of possible atomic configurations,
[
53
,
8
,
31
]
such reasoning ability could enable targeted efforts toward the most informative regions of chemical space, transforming the rate and nature of discovery.
Despite this potential, reasoning-driven autonomy remains challenging in materials science. Materials design is resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise and substantial computational effort.
[
38
]
Even with advances in automation, the process from concept to verified material can extend over years.
[
58
]
Current high-throughput atomistic simulation workflows have accelerated certain aspects of this process by enabling parallel screening of large chemical spaces,
[
23
,
2
]
but they offer limited adaptivity and cannot reason to select the next computation. Failed calculations still require human intervention to diagnose and repair errors, limiting true automation.
Machine learning has introduced new paradigms for accelerating materials discovery through data-driven predictive and generative modeling.
[
35
,
57
,
56
]
However, while these models achieve high accuracy, they remain confined to their training distributions and cannot interpret results within an adaptive, iterative scientific framework. Because materials discovery is inherently a multi-stage reasoning process, from hypothesis generation to experimental validation, these models play a crucial but limited role, addressing computation rather than scientific decision-making.
Large language models (LLMs) bring reasoning capabilities to scientific research. They integrate knowledge, generate executable code, interface with tools, and reason in natural language.
[
50
,
14
,
7
]
These abilities position LLMs as coordinators of end-to-end discovery workflows that link hypothesis generation, simulation, and analysis. However, LLMs acting in isolation face challenges including limited numerical precision, error accumulation, and lack of persistent state.
[
36
]
Stateless interactions prevent them from retaining context, coordinating across tools, or adapting strategies based on intermediate results. Robust scientific reasoning therefore requires agentic architectures,
[
44
]
i.e., systems coupling LLMs to memory, adaptive planning, and iterative feedback.
Recent studies have shown that LLM agents can manage computational materials workflows with impressive autonomy. Systems such as VASPilot,

[

and ChemGraph,
[
43

workflows spanning structure preparation, job execution, error recovery, and postprocessing. Beyond single-job automation, DREAMS
[
54
]
and MOFGen
[
29
]
extend autonomy to networked simulation environments. In DREAMS, specialized agents coordinate the setup and execution of Quantum Espresso
[
18
,

]
calculations with automated convergence checks and recovery from failure. Moreover, LLMatDesign
[
20
]
introduced a self-reflective loop in which a LLM refined its proposals using a surrogate model pre-trained on density functional theory (DFT) data.
Here, we introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework that equips ensembles of LLMs with structured, collective reasoning for guided materials discovery. Designed around reasoning autonomy, MASTER coordinates interacting agents to deliberate, critique, and refine hypotheses through structured collaboration, deciding what atomistic simulations to perform and how to interpret their outcomes. Within this framework (Fig.
1
a), a multimodal subsystem links natural-language objectives to validated DFT workflows, ensuring accurate generation of atomic structures, input files, and convergence parameters. Meanwhile, higher-level reasoning agents decide which materials to investigate next based on intermediate results. This separation of concerns allows the system to frame decision-making as a reasoning process that integrates individual perspectives into shared conclusions while preserving the rigor of first-principles computation.
To evaluate how reasoning architecture influences discovery efficiency, we compare a single-agent baseline with three hierarchical multi-agent strategies—peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. These architectures are tested using CO binding energetics across two chemical domains: transition-metal (M) adatoms on a Cu(100) surface and M–N–C single-atom catalysts.
[

MASTER identifies targeted binding energies within only a few iterations, whereas trial-and-error selection requires an order of magnitude more trials. For the highest-performing systems, analysis of reasoning trajectories reveals coherent and scientifically grounded decision patterns, reflecting how structured collaboration shapes adaptive, mechanistically informed exploration.
Results
MASTER Framework and Benchmark Materials Problem
The MASTER framework integrates LLM reasoning with autonomous electronic-structure simulation in a closed loop that emulates the operation of a scientific research team (Fig.
1
a). The system is organized into three tightly coupled yet functionally distinct layers. The design layer comprises a team of LLM agents that use natural language to formulate hypotheses and deliberate, individually or collectively, on which material to evaluate next based on the accumulated simulation history. Once a candidate structure is chosen, the information is passed to the simulation layer, which provides a multimodal interface that converts high-level simulation objectives into validated DFT workflows. Here, a team of DFT agents autonomously generates inputs, atomic geometries, and executes first-principles calculations. The computed quantities, such as adsorption energies, are then returned to the review layer where a reviewer agent determines whether the specified criteria have been met or further exploration is required. By explicitly separating reasoning from simulation, the design agents focus on interpreting trends, weighing evidence, and planning experiments, while the DFT and reviewer agents handle numerical execution and verification, respectively. Together, these layers operationalize an autonomous scientific method, transforming static computational screening into an adaptive and self-correcting exploration of chemical space through LLM reasoning and first-principles feedback.

It depends sensitively on the local electronic and geometric environment, producing a chemically intricate landscape that challenges autonomous LLM reasoning. Two scenarios are considered here (Figs.
1
b and
1
c). The first examines CO adsorption on transition-metal adatoms supported on Cu(100), a model for undercoordinated catalytic sites where low coordination substantially modifies the local binding environment.
[
11
]
The second extends the study to CO adsorption on M-N-C single-atom catalysts,
[
13
]
where the metal is coordinated by nitrogen ligands within a graphene host, introducing distinct ligand-field and covalency effects. Each domain spans twenty-eight transition metals from Sc to Au with DFT-computed adsorption energies. Four target CO binding-energy ranges were chosen in each case, spanning weak to strong binding regimes (Methods). In this context, MASTER must learn and generalize structure–property relationships directly from first-principles data and navigate complex search spaces without human guidance.
Natural Language to Density Functional Theory Simulations
The adatom adsorption problem provides an ideal proof-of-principle for MASTER because it represents a complex case that encapsulates the fundamental challenges in automating atomic-scale simulation, especially for the field of electrocatalysis.
[
39
]
Indeed, researchers may describe an idea succinctly, such as “place a CO molecule on an Ag adatom supported on Cu(100)”, but DFT codes require constructing the appropriate crystallographic surface, identifying high-symmetry adsorption sites, optimizing supercell dimensions, and defining vacuum spacing to avoid artificial slab couplings. MASTER must therefore translate scientific intent expressed in natural language, into fully executable simulations. Even when computational choices such as exchange–correlation functional or
k
k
-point meshes remain constant, each new atomic system must be built from scratch to capture the intended chemistry accurately. Thus, the Cu(100) adatom system offers a rigorous benchmark in which success or failure is unambiguous and the translation challenge is fully exposed.

structure file (POSCAR) together with visualizations of the top, profile, and side views. It completes an expert-prepared structured form (SI Note
Supplementary Note 2. Geometry Review Form
) that focuses the agent’s reasoning context on the most common fault points in surface geometries. The Geometry Reviewer reads this form to determine whether the geometry is correct. If it is incorrect, then it issues a retry request with targeted feedback to CODEX. This loop continues until the geometry satisfies all criteria.
c
, The final output is the validated POSCAR file describing the intended adsorbate-surface configuration.
To operationalize this translation, the simulation layer of MASTER implements an agentic DFT subsystem composed of three collaborating agents: CODEX,
[
9
]
a Form Filler, and a Geometry Reviewer (Figure
2
). Collectively, they convert natural-language queries
into validated DFT inputs. This framework employs a pure prompting strategy that preserves the flexibility of LLMs while enforcing the precision required for scientific computation. Rather than using rigid templates or parsers, the CODEX agent receives rich contextual information, namely the user’s natural language query, detailed ASE
[
30
,
3
]
usage patterns for surface science applications, and representative DFT workflows. At its core, the subsystem relies on intentional context engineering, since the structured inputs and reviewer evaluations allow subsequent agents to detect inconsistencies and correct earlier errors. This enables generalization to new materials, adsorption geometries, and co-adsorption motifs beyond the capabilities of rigid automation.
Here, we specialize the prompting context to surface–adsorbate systems, which steers the agents toward Cu(100) adatoms and CO adsorption geometries; this reflects the engineered scope of our demonstrations rather than a fundamental limitation of the framework. MASTER can be extended to other structure families, e.g., metal centers embedded in a pre-established N-doped carbon host,
[
13
]
by providing the corresponding structural priors in context. Likewise, supplying appropriate examples of input formats enables the simulation agents to target VASP,

[

Unlike distributed orchestration frameworks
[
54
,
29
]
that coordinate large-scale pipelines, MASTER focuses on scientific reasoning and generates structures through a refinement loop in which stochastic variability is an asset: successive attempts explore alternative configurations, and the reviewer filters them so that only corrected geometries advance. This process links the flexibility of LLMs with first-principles checks and produces reliable results through guided exploration rather than deterministic programming.

Standard deviations were computed using 5,000 bootstrap resamples.
b
, Osmium adatom example showing sequential correction across retries. Context built through multimodal evaluation and feedback between agents enables accurate generation and validation of the final geometry.
Benchmarking demonstrates that this prompt-based agentic approach achieves a 97.2% success rate across all test cases after implementing self-revision loops, as shown in Figure
3
a (see Methods). Here, success refers to generating a geometry that passes subject matter expert review following the geometry review form (Supplementary Note
Supplementary Note 2. Geometry Review Form
). The subsystem handles both simple adatom placement and more complex adsorption scenarios involving the placement of CO molecules on the desired site. The self-correction loop steadily improves accuracy: 47.8% of cases succeed on the first iteration, 43.3% on the second, and 6.1% on the third. Overall success rates remain high, 97.8% for adatom-only and 96.7% for CO-adsorbed systems, with the latter requiring more iterations due to the complexity of molecular orientation (e.g., 11.1% vs 1.1% third-iteration convergence). The CO adsorption energies shown in Fig.
1
b, obtained from fully relaxed DFT calculations, confirm that the constructed geometries are physically meaningful. This strong performance reflects the engineered flow of context between agents, which ensures that information about earlier errors is carried forward and corrected in subsequent attempts.
A representative example of osmium adatom placement on Cu(100) illustrates the iterative refinement process (Figure
3
b). In the first iteration, the generated structure had only two Cu layers instead of the six requested, an error immediately flagged by the Geometry Reviewer. The second iteration corrected the layer count but misplaced the CO molecule with oxygen facing the Os adatom rather than carbon, violating the user’s instructions. Only in the third iteration did the system successfully generate the correct structure. This establishes a robust foundation for autonomous DFT execution, demonstrating that LLM agents can reliably translate complex materials specifications into computational workflows without manual intervention.
LLM Reasoning Strategies for Accelerated Materials Discovery
While accurate simulations are essential to the success of the developed agentic approach, the overall efficiency of autonomous discovery depends on how effectively reasoning agents navigate chemical space. Efficient exploration reduces the number of DFT evaluations, whose cost far outweighs that of LLM reasoning. To examine this portion of the workflow, we implemented four agentic reasoning architectures within the MASTER framework. In all configurations, the agents are instructed to apply chemical intuition, drawing on periodic trends,
d
d
-band theory from their pretraining, and correlations inferred from previous iterations, to propose new material candidates within the same closed loop involving the DFT and reviewer systems described in Fig.
1
. The strategies differ in how they engineer the context used to generate and refine hypotheses, ranging from single agent reasoning to structured methods of collaboration and hierarchy. The four architectures, illustrated schematically in Fig.
4
, are:
Single agent –
A baseline configuration in which a single LLM autonomously decides the next candidate for evaluation, measuring the capability of one agent to perform self-consistent scientific reasoning without collaboration (Fig.
4
a-c).
Peer review –
A minimal form of collaboration in which two identical but independent agents propose candidates that are reconciled by an arbitrator, testing whether peer oversight improves reliability (Fig.
4
d).
Triage-ranking –
A hierarchical design in which a coarse selector proposes a pool of promising candidates that a fine selector ranks and chooses from, separating exploration from exploitation while retaining chemical diversity (Fig.
4
e).
Triage-forms –
Similar to triage-ranking but with an additional agent that fills prewritten expert-designed forms for each candidate before the fine selector makes a decision, testing whether guided context improves efficiency over free-form deliberation (Fig.
4
f).
All reasoning strategies were benchmarked within the above-mentioned transition-metal chemical space, enabling a controlled proof-of-principle testbed for autonomous discovery, as shown in Figs.

and
5
. We use GPT-5
[

]
as the base model for all agents. The four target adsorption-energy windows defined in Fig.

Figure
4
summarizes the performance of the four argentic reasoning architectures and their final selected species statistics are presented in Figures
S4
-
S7
. The single agent baseline (Fig.
4
a-c) converges reliably within fewer than ten iterations for all targets, reflecting directed exploration rather than random search. Even alone, the single agent outperforms stochastic baselines (Fig.
5
a), yielding 100% cumulative success three times faster than trial-and-error, showing that LLMs already encode physically meaningful priors. The peer review configuration (Fig.
4
d) performs similarly to the single agent, with no discernible performance gain. The species selector agents agreed on the next material in about 60% of runs while the arbitrator alternated evenly between them otherwise. Their differences were largely stochastic rather than chemically substantive, offering little additional guidance to the arbitrator. This suggests that collective reasoning can only improve performance when agents bring complementary perspectives or distinct priors.
In contrast, the triage-ranking system (Fig.
4
e) achieves the most decisive convergence with an average performance gain as high as 2.14 iterations compared to the single agent baseline. Most runs identify an acceptable adatom within two or three iterations, showing improvement across all target energy windows. Its hierarchical structure balances exploration by the coarse selector with exploitation by the fine selector. By constraining comparison to a small, curated subset, the fine selector receives engineered context while remaining scalable. The triage-forms architecture (Fig.
4
f), which combines a coarse selector, a structured form-filler, and a fine selector, performs slightly below triage-ranking but above the single agent across most energy windows. The best performance was obtained with a form emphasizing relative risk assessment, categorizing each option as a “safe bet”, “moderate risk”, “high risk”, or “unlikely”, identifying the top safe bet when available, and providing a brief rationale (SI Note
Supplementary Note 7. Prompt, system messages, and form for the triage-forms architecture for the transition metal adatom on Cu(100) case
). This design elicits qualitative scientific reasoning, whereas forms that required quantitative predictions, such as
d
d
-band-center estimates, consistently degraded performance.
Fig.
5
a-b presents cumulative success probabilities comparing reasoning architectures with three baselines: a theoretical random sampler, a Monte Carlo agent, and a rogue agent instructed to act randomly but allowed to reason (Methods). Across weak and strong binding windows, the single agent system outperforms the purely stochastic baselines, yielding three fold and eleven fold improvements, respectively. The triage-ranking architecture achieves the steepest success rise, identifying correct candidates within a few iterations and reaching near-unit cumulative probability sooner than any other approach. The rogue agent provides an instructive control: although nominally random, it exhibits a persistent semantic bias toward 5
d
d
elements in the early iterations (see pie chart inset). For the strong-binding target (–2.0 to –1.6 eV), this bias fortuitously aligns with the physical trend of increasing CO affinity down the 5
d
d
series, yielding apparent outperformance over all other agentic systems. For the weak-binding window (–0.3 to 0 eV), however, the same bias becomes detrimental, steering exploration away from relevant metals and causing success probabilities below even Monte Carlo levels. Cumulative success probabilities for the remaining adsorption energy windows for the Cu(100) case are presented in Figure
S3
. These behaviors reveal that unguided LLM priors can occasionally mimic chemical intuition but remain unreliable without grounding in simulation feedback. Cross-architecture performance differences also reflect a general principle from optimization theory: according to the no-free-lunch theorem
[
55
]
, no single search strategy can be optimal across all problem classes. Consistent with this, triage-ranking excels for most Cu(100) targets, whereas other agentic designs perform comparatively or better in the M–N–C catalysts (Figures
S8
and
S9
).

Discussion
To understand the behavior of the design agents, we first note that Fig.
4
c reveals systematic trends with reasoning level. Increasing the GPT-5 reasoning effort generally reduces the mean number of iterations by roughly one, with some targets improving by up to two. For the weak-binding range, for example, minimal-reasoning agents selected Ag first in nearly all runs and reached Au only after several steps, while high-reasoning agents chose Au directly in roughly one-third of cases, reducing the average iterations from
3.5
3.5
to
2.6
2.6
. Given the cost of DFT calculations, this reduction represents a meaningful computational gain since each iteration requires two DFT simulations (with and without CO adsorbed). Minimal-reasoning tends to rely primarily on positional heuristics along the periodic table, whereas high-reasoning agents invoke mechanistic and structural arguments (Fig.
5
c). For instance, at high reasoning effort references to coordination effects appear nearly an order of magnitude more often and orbital interactions roughly three times as frequent as in minimal-reasoning runs.
We next examine the factors that influence iteration-1 success for the –0.3 to 0 eV adsorption-energy window for the Cu(100) adatom system (Fig.
5
d). At this stage, the agents have not yet received any DFT results, so success depends solely on how the architecture structures information before feedback. The single agent baseline reflects the model’s ability to propose a plausible candidate from the prompt alone. Adding contextualization, i.e., enumerating all materials and requesting a qualitative ranking, improves accuracy across reasoning levels. At low and medium reasoning effort, the hierarchical multi-agent structure provides an additional gain: the coarse selector’s prescreening and the fine selector’s focused ranking further increase the likelihood of identifying a chemically reasonable first candidate. At high reasoning effort hierarchy offers little additional benefit. Taken together, the results show that the largest gains from hierarchical context engineering arise when reasoning depth is limited or when the candidate set cannot be exhaustively ranked by a single agent. In larger and more heterogeneous spaces, where full enumeration would be impractical, multi-agent hierarchies are therefore expected to play a central role in maintaining high early decision quality.

metals (Ir, Os, Re, Rh, W) reflects a superficial association between atomic number and adsorption strength. Once these strong-binding early choices fail and the semantically driven prior collapses, the agent explores the space diffusely. By contrast, the triage-ranking agents (Fig.

These trajectory patterns rationalize the performance trends observed in Figs.

. Hierarchical architectures not only accelerate convergence but also reorganize exploration into pathways guided by causal chemical reasoning rather than statistical association. As the system learns to associate structural and electronic features with adsorption strength, exploration becomes self-correcting, with each iteration reducing uncertainty. In this way, collective reasoning achieves efficiency through progressive information gain rather than exhaustive enumeration.
To quantify the exploration dynamics, we computed the normalized and mean normalized Shannon entropies
[
19
]
for each architecture (Fig.
6
c-d). Shannon entropy measures how broadly an agentic architecture distributes its selections across the transition metals in each iteration, with lower values indicating a more focused and information-efficient search.
[
47
,
52
]
The rogue agent and Monte Carlo baselines maintain persistently high entropy, consistent with their erratic exploration. By contrast, both single agent and triage-ranking architectures exhibit pronounced entropy contraction, with the latter achieving the lowest mean entropy overall. These results show that the hierarchical architectures outperform the single agent baseline because the context they propagate systematically provides information advantage that guides the search toward the correct region of the search space in fewer iterations.
In the present MASTER implementation, the design agents have no
a priori
knowledge of the absolute adsorption-energy scale or level of theory used in our DFT calculations. They must instead infer these scales on the fly from the sequence of simulation outcomes and the acceptance criteria, learning which regimes correspond to weak, intermediate, or strong binding. In small, fully enumerable spaces such as our adatom benchmark, this implicit calibration is sufficient. In larger or less well-characterized domains, however, an additional retrieval-augmented agent could supply prior grounding by querying literature or materials databases, improving robustness and accelerating convergence when simulations are costly or the underlying energy landscape is complex. Similarly, structured, form-based triage is likely to become more valuable in such regimes, where standardized prompts can stabilize reasoning, enforce consistent comparison criteria, and preserve interpretability across many interacting agents.
Altogether, our findings show that structured agentic collaboration transforms large language models from procedural tools into adaptive scientific reasoners. Within MASTER, autonomy arises from interaction: agents that deliberate, incorporate feedback, and refine shared hypotheses guide exploration with increasing mechanistic consistency. By linking language, simulation, and theory into a unified workflow, MASTER enables efficient, self-correcting discovery. Across the CO-adsorption problems studied here, this combination of hierarchical reasoning and autonomous simulation reduces the number of required atomistic calculations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error while preserving first-principles accuracy. Extending such architectures beyond materials science could enable general-purpose scientific agents capable of autonomous hypothesis formation and reasoning across the physical and life sciences.

For structural relaxation of the surfaces, the planar initial structure and a structure with the transition metal center displaced 0.6 Å out of plane are both relaxed. This is done to avoid trapping in high-energy meta-stable configurations; the lower-energy optimized is used as the reference structure for subsequent CO adsorption calculations. CO-adsorbed structures are generated by placing CO above the transition metal center in three initial configurations: with the carbon atom bound to the surface and the oxygen atom in line with vector normal to the surface, with the oxygen atom bound to the surface and the carbon atom in line with vector normal to the surface, and a bidentate configuration with the C-O bond positioned directly above the transition metal and oriented parallel to the surface. The adsorbate structure which yields the lowest overall energy is then used for computing adsorption energy similarly to Eq.

LLM Framework for Density Functional Theory Simulations
The atomic position generation component of MASTER uses a three-agent workflow built on OpenAI Agents SDK (version 0.0.18).
[
41
]
The Geometry Generator agent receives a natural language structure request and constructs a prompt containing the user query plus a JSON knowledge base with twelve ASE construction tips covering site placement, molecular orientation, and covalent radii for common surface atoms and adsorbates (SI Note
Supplementary Note 1. Geometry Tips Sheet
). This prompt is passed to Codex (version 0.57.0)
[
9
]
via command-line interface as a subprocess, which returns a Python script using ASE library functions. The script executes in an isolated temporary directory to produce a VASP POSCAR file. The Geometry Generator agent then creates three orthogonal structure visualizations (top, side, and profile views) and transfers control to the Form Filler agent, which accesses outputs through shared filesystem directories.
The Form Filler agent analyzes the POSCAR file to verify atomic composition and layer count, examines the three visualization images, and completes an eight-question binary assessment (SI Note
Supplementary Note 2. Geometry Review Form
) evaluating composition, layer constraints, site placement, orientation, and vertical spacing. For the current surface adsorption application, assessment questions include domain-specific criteria such as “was the adsorbate placed in the right place” (evaluating hollow, bridge, or on-top site occupancy) and “were the adsorbates placed in the right orientation” (verifying molecular geometry such as C-down vs O-down for CO). The form template and construction tips are modular components that can be modified for other simulation domains by replacing the assessment criteria and construction guidelines while preserving the three-agent workflow architecture.
The completed form transfers to the Reviewer agent, which inspects the images and POSCAR file for consistency with the form assessment and makes the final acceptance decision. Structures pass only if all eight questions receive affirmative responses and required files exist. Rejection triggers written feedback specifying identified deficiencies and returns control to the generator agent with incremented version numbering. The generator agent incorporates this feedback into revised Codex prompts for iterative refinement, supporting up to five cycles. Rejected structures archive to version-controlled subdirectories preserving the complete revision history. All agent decisions, Codex prompts, and generated scripts log to structured markdown files for reproducibility.
Benchmarking Protocol for Agentic LLM Reasoning
We benchmarked four reasoning strategies in MASTER using the OpenAI Agents SDK with GPT-5 models.
[
40
]
All agents operated at low verbosity, and the reasoning effort parameter, as implemented by OpenAI, was swept across minimal, low, medium, and high settings.
[
42
]
The search space for both the adatom and M-N-C test cases comprised the 28 transition metals from Sc to Au. Targets were specified as numerical adsorption-energy bands (e.g., -0.6 eV to -0.3 eV) without tolerance, and each run terminated when the reviewer confirmed that the measured energy laid within the specified band. Each strategy was executed as independent batches spanning four adsorption-energy windows (SI Note
Supplementary Note 3. Queries
). For every window and reasoning-effort level, one hundred runs were recorded. Within each run, the selector proposed an untested element from the Sc–Au set, the evaluator returned a fixed ground-truth adsorption energy from DFT computations, and the reviewer determined whether the band criterion had been met. Invalid or duplicate proposals were rejected and re-prompted up to a total of 20 maximum retries. The trial is considered a failure if the system reaches the maximum number of retries. In all tests we preformed in this paper, we never observed a failed trial. The prompts and system messages used for all agentic architectures are presented in SI Notes

To establish a theoretical baseline for comparison, we computed the cumulative probability of success for random sampling without replacement as

where

is the total number of transition metals candidates,
K
K
is the number of correct materials within the target energy band,
i
i
is the iteration index, and
(
n
k
)
\binom{n}{k}
denotes the binomial coefficient.
In addition to the reasoning-based strategies, we also implemented two control agents to assess the impact of strategic reasoning versus pure randomness. The Monte Carlo agent employs a deterministic random number generator tool that selects a uniform random index from 1 to 28, mapping each index to the corresponding transition metal in the Sc–Au series (SI Note
Supplementary Note 12. Prompt and system messages for the Monte Carlo agent architecture
). The agent is instructed to call this tool without applying any materials science reasoning, providing a computationally controlled random baseline. The rogue agent, by contrast, is an LLM-based selector instructed to perform completely random selection with no strategic reasoning, bias, or optimization (SI Note
Supplementary Note 13. Prompt and system messages for the rogue agent architecture
). The rogue agent is explicitly prohibited in prompting from using materials science concepts (periodic trends,
d
d
-band theory, electronegativity) and is directed to select candidates as if rolling dice, establishing an LLM-based random baseline that tests whether the model can suppress its reasoning priors when instructed to do so.
LLM Chemical Concept Usage Analysis
To quantify how GPT-5 reasoning effort influences performance, we analyzed the chemical concepts invoked by the single agent system across all chemical targets (Fig.
1
b) for minimal and high reasoning effort. This analysis enables us to determine how the model’s conceptual grounding shifts with reasoning effort and directly supports the comparison shown in Figure
5
c. We defined eight categories representing distinct chemical concepts, with each category encompassing multiple keyword variants to capture linguistic variations (Table
S2
). These categories can be broadly grouped into structural concepts (coordination effects, backbonding, 4
d
d
/5
d
d
orbital interactions) and elemental concepts (periodic trends, nearest neighbor, and late transition metal classifications). The keyword matching procedure performs case-insensitive substring searches within each reasoning statement, counting a statement as positive for a category if any variant appears. Each statement contributes at most one count per category, preventing double-counting when multiple variants of the same concept appear in a single statement.
Frequency calculations proceed by dividing the number of statements containing each category’s keywords by the total number of statements analyzed, expressed as percentages. For minimal reasoning, we analyzed 1,684 statements across all energy windows and runs; for high reasoning, 1,215 statements. The resulting percentages represent the fraction of selection decisions that invoked each chemical concept category.
Shannon Entropy
To analyze the heterogeneity of species selected across iterations, we computed the normalized Shannon entropy for each iteration (
4
).
[
47
,

]
We first construct the probability distribution
p
j
(

)
p_{j}^{(i)}
based on the frequency with which each species
j
j
was selected across all active runs at iteration
i
i
. The Shannon entropy
H

H_{i}
is then computed as

H_{i}=-\sum_{j=1}^{N}p_{j}^{(i)}\log(p_{j}^{(i)}),

where

is the total number of candidate species. To normalize the Shannon entropy to the range [0,1], we divide by the maximum possible entropy

.
H_{\text{norm}}^{(i)}=\frac{H_{i}}{\log{N}}.
(4)
This normalized entropy equals 1 when all species are equally likely to have been chosen (maximum heterogeneity) and approaches 0 as selection becomes concentrated on fewer species (lower heterogeneity). To characterize the overall exploration behavior of each agentic architecture across an entire run, we computed the mean normalized Shannon entropy
H

\bar{H}_{\text{norm}}

\bar{H}_{\text{norm}}=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T}H_{\text{norm}}^{(i)}.

This metric represents the average normalized Shannon entropy per iteration, providing a single value that captures the typical heterogeneity level maintained throughout the selection process.

Supplementary Note 1. Geometry Tips Sheet
adsorbate_placement_center
Description:
Do
not
assume geometric center is a valid site.
Use ASE named sites:
position=‘hollow’|‘bridge’|‘ontop’
as appropriate; for Cu(100) hollow is required for the adatom.
Reason:
Hollow/bridge/ontop are crystallographic sites; numeric centering can be wrong for many cells.
single_adsorbate_only
Description:
Only one adsorbate should be present in each simulation.
Reason:
Multiple adsorbates can introduce unwanted interactions and complicate the analysis.
co_orientation
Description:
CO must be C-down. Determine indices by symbol (
c_idx
for
C
,
o_idx
for
O
); never assume order from
molecule(‘CO’)
.
After placement, assert
d
⁡
(
C
−
Ag
)
<
d
⁡
(
O
−
Ag
)
d(\mathrm{C{-}Ag})<d(\mathrm{O{-}Ag})
; if not, rotate 180° about
x
x
and re-check.
Reason:
Prevents O-down mistakes caused by CO index ordering differences across ASE versions.
co_anchoring_rules
Description:
Anchor CO by carbon:
add_adsorbate(slab, co, height, position=(x_ag, y_ag), mol_index=c_idx)
.
Then set Ag–C distance directly to 1.90 Å
(
slab.set_distance(c_idx, ag_idx, 1.90, fix=1, mic=True)
).
Reason:
Directly controls the chemisorption bond length and avoids compounding height sums.
no_overlap
Description:
Ensure adsorbate atoms do not overlap with each other or with the slab.

adatom_site_centering
Description:
Use ASE’s named site: call
add_adsorbate(..., position=‘hollow’)
to place the adatom at a crystallographic fourfold hollow.
Do
not
assume numeric (0.5, 0.5) corresponds to a hollow; site coordinates depend on the cell.
After placement, if symmetry is desired, translate the adsorbate laterally to the supercell center while preserving hollow registry.
Reason:
Guarantees the correct hollow site across surfaces/lattices and avoids misplacement when the geometric center is not the hollow site.
adatom_height_rule
Description:
Initial adatom height above top Cu plane:

Å by lifting minimally if needed.
Reason:
Prevents initial overlaps while keeping realistic starting distances.

Å.
Cap iterations (e.g., 200–400).
Reason:
Avoids excessive lifting that pushes CO unrealistically far from the surface.
pbc_and_vacuum
Description:
Keep PBC True in x,y; after all adsorbates are added, recenter with 15 Å vacuum along z:
slab.center(vacuum=15.0, axis=2)
.
Reason:
Ensures the final structure has correct separation in z and consistent periodicity.
fix_bottom_layers
Description:
Constrain only the bottom 2 Cu layers using tags/z-order; exclude adatom and CO from constraints.
Reason:
Matches standard slab relaxation protocols and the user’s request.
poscar_writing
Description:
When writing VASP, prefer
write(‘POSCAR’, slab, vasp5=True, direct=True, sort=False)
to preserve adsorbate ordering for auditability.
Reason:
Stable atom ordering eases downstream validation and debugging.
ase_usage_required
Description:
Use ASE tools and utilities for all slab construction, adsorbate placement, and structural manipulation tasks.

YOUR ROLE:
You are the Fine Selector (Tier 2) in a two-tier materials selection system.

Your task is to select exactly ONE best candidate from this pool, based on how likely it is to satisfy the user’s target constraint.
APPROACH:
1.
Parse the user’s target constraint or adsorption energy band as precisely as possible.
2.
For each candidate in the provided pool, use your materials science knowledge (periodic trends, d-band theory, group/row effects, electronic structure, etc.) to estimate or reason about their relative adsorption strength.
3.
Explicitly rank the candidates in the pool according to expected adsorption strength (e.g., strongest to weakest, or as appropriate for the target).
4.
Compare your ranking to the user’s target/band, and select the candidate whose expected adsorption energy is closest to or just inside the target region.
5.
Optionally, refer to previous DFT result trends to refine your ranking or the final choice, if such data is provided.
6.
Do not exaggerate differences between candidates in the pool; the prior agent has already filtered for plausible options, so relative differences are typically moderate.
RULES:
-
Select exactly ONE element, and it MUST be from the provided pool.

Do NOT consider previous results’ energies or patterns.
5.
Do NOT try to optimize or be strategic in any way.
6.
Simply pick randomly as if rolling dice.
Self-check before output:
-
Ensure species_selected is within the defined material search space and not in the Previously tested list.
-
Ensure your selection was truly random with NO strategic bias.
-
If either condition is violated, correct yourself before output.
Output exactly one JSON line and no extra text:
{ "species_selected": "ElementSymbol", "reasoning": "Randomly selected from available untested species" }
Stop: do not output anything other than that one JSON line.

Review Agent System Message
"""You analyze DFT results and decide whether to continue or stop.
RULES (parse the target from target_query):
-
First verify the species is within the defined material search space. If not, set continue=true and note the invalid selection.
-
Use explicit ranges the user provides (e.g., "between
−
1.2
-1.2
and
−
1.7
-1.7
eV").
-
You may ONLY stop (continue=false) if the current energy lies inside the band you parsed from target_query.
-
Do NOT stop based on trends, lack of improvement, or iteration counts.
OUTPUT FORMAT: Always end with JSON only:
{{ "continue": <true/false>, "reason": "<concise scientific rationale referencing the band parsed from target_query>" }}
Examples:
-
In-band (explicit range): {{"continue": false, "reason": "Current energy
−
0.50
-0.50
eV is within the user’s band [
−
0.60
-0.60
,
−
0.40
-0.40
] eV"}}
-
Out-of-band (explicit range): {{"continue": true, "reason": "Current energy
−
1.25
-1.25
eV is outside the user’s band [
−
0.80
-0.80
,
−
0.60
-0.60
] eV"}}
-
Invalid selection: {{"continue": true, "reason": "Selected species is outside the defined material search space. Must continue search."}}
